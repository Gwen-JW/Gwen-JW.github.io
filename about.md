Welcome to my website!

This is Jiawen Wei, and I am originally from Zhejiang, China. I am currently a research assistant in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Central South University (CSU). I obtained my Master in Control Science and Engineering and my undergraduate degrees in Automation from CSU in 2021 and 2018, respectively.

My research involves Machine/Deep Learning in mechanical and fluid systems, especially using **Deep Reinforcement Learning with the attention mechanism** to extract and select feature representations to optimize the sensor placement without jeopardizing the strategy learning process.

Out of my personal curiosity, motivation and research interests, now I'm looking for an opportunity to pursue a Ph.D. degree, with concentration in combining learning methods with different tasks, including but not limited to **detection, conception, modeling and optimization**.

Here is my [CV](/assets/CV.pdf)(last update Dec. 2021).
